I am an innovative full stack data scientist / machine learning engineer specialising in developing autonomous, user-driven AI systems. Currently spearheading generative AI initiatives at [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com), where I architect prompt safety frameworks, optimize model interactions, and pioneer intelligent routing systems that match user prompts to the most appropriate AI models. My work combines technical expertise with a focus on creating robust, self-improving systems that enhance user experience and operational efficiency.

I aim to post here regularly, but post whenever life allows
